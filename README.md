# Install from a VSIX

You can manually install a VS Code extension packaged in a `.vsix` file. Using the Install from VSIX... command in the Extensions view command drop-down, or the Extensions: Install from VSIX... command in the Command Palette, point to the `.vsix` file.

You can also install using the VS Code `--install-extension` command line switch providing the path to the `.vsix` file.

```bash
code --install-extension sftp-debug.vsix
```
